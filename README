------------------------
Tested Scenarios
------------------------
All scenarios, as listed below and in the traceability matrix, are functional.
- Power device on or off
- Continuous circuit check for skin contact
- Frequency changed
- Waveform changed
- Countdown cycle changed
- Current changed
- Therapy begins when skin contact is made
- Battery warning issued when at 5%
- Battery warning issued at 2% and powers off
- Saved Therapy properly displays the Duration, Current, Frequency and Waveform of Therapy when used
- Therapy saving on Therapy end if Therapy Saving is On
- Therapy saving on Toggling Power off mid Therapy if Therapy Saving is On
- Therapy saving cannot be toggled during a Therapy session
- Countdown Cycle, Toggle Frequency, Toggle Waveform cannot be toggled during a Therapy session
